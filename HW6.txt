1. Page 167 exercise 3.1:
Indicate the binding time (when the language is designed, when the program is linked, when the program begins execution, etc.) for each of the following decisions in your favorite programming language and implementation. Explain any answers you think are open to interpretation.

Let's go with C++ for this.

a) The number of built-in functions (math, type queries, etc.)
Design Time; because they are built-in and not library functions, they are known immediately.

b) The variable declaration that corresponds to a particular variable reference (use)
Run Time; while they can be known before linking time, the binding itself does not occur until Run Time.

c) The maximum length allowed for a constant (literal) character string
Design Time; this value is known immediately as it is a literal, and not stored as a variable per-say.

d) The referencing environment for a subroutine that is passed as a parameter
Run Time; again, it may be inferred earlier, but it is not actually bound until it is run.

e) The address of a particular library routine
Link Time; if it's in a library it has to be linked first, but it is known before the program begins running.

f) The total amount of space occupied by program code and data
Link Time; technically it happens after everything is linked, but it still is reserved before execution begins.
